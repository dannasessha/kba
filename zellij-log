`paru -Syu zellij`
installed from community arch repo, listed here https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/zellij/
`mkdir ~/.config/zellij`
`zellij setup --dump-config > ~/.config/zellij/config.yaml`
...sets up a default config file.

The first alpha was early 2021, seems to be client-server model.
zellij claims to be a 'workspace' and advertises it is more broadly useful than screen or tmux. 
ie, it has more functionality, features, or bloat.
"Zellij is a workspace aimed at developers, ops-oriented people and anyone who loves the terminal."

there's really just a few subcommands,
`a` [target session]
attach session
`ls`
list sessions
`k` [target session]
`ka`
kill sessions / kill all

There are also a few setup and flag options, but just start with  

`zellij`

With the application open...
Notice the sweet bars!
The Tab Bar at the top, the (adaptive!) Tip Bar at the bottom and I think also the default Status Bar are all examples of plugins.
Plugins can be written in any language that can compile to webassembly. The plugin API is described as a WIP.

The Tab Bar is giving me my session name [I got (kind-decision) - how nice!] and what tab I am looking at. 
I believe zellij is _modal_, and the status bar is displaying which mode is being used. Try

`<CTRL-t>`  
`n`
`<CTRL-p>`
`n`

Cool hunh??

A few things I discovered just browsing around really quickly: 
`<ENTER>` to select a pane and interact with it.
<ALT-+> and <ALT--> resize panes in "normal mode" and <CTRL-n> 
then + - does the same. 
It's possible to navigate fairly quickly through panes in one or more tabs with <ATL-hjkl>
<CTRL-G> "locked interface mode" seems to stop zellij from interacting with a pane until it is unlocked with the same keybinding.

Config options (including keybindings) and Layout are configurable with YAML. This stuff looks extensive.
Layouts define the placement of the terminal panes, and can also include other configuration options like what plugins to use.
 
An awesome feature, new in last release, share sessions with others! (I believe including remote connections!)

*strider plugin = console file manager
*there is a "tmux mode"
I have looked at github stuff.

Planned possible future browser support as frontend.

I also found another rust based multiplexer: https://github.com/austinjones/tab-rs
